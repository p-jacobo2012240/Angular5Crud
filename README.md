## Why does this project exist ?

In recent years GraphQL has taken on a lot of importance given its way of consuming, documenting and exposing information, among these use cases, I have had the opportunity to use it as a gateway for microservices and I have seen its efficiency so I decided to do this project which abort issues like event syncing and graphql as getway api
